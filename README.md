# Plex Together

Plex Together is a tool to sync [Plex](http://plex.tv) content across multiple players in multiple locations. Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io), Plex Together runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

**Plex Together is not yet ready for general public use. Most features are still being developed and tested. Please consider the current stage of the app a very early alpha.**

**If you are unfamiliar with NodeJS, Electron, debugging and port forwarding, this release is not for you. But don't worry! In the near future we'll be releasing a more user friendly update which will include public Plex Together servers without the need of hosting your own (if you choose).**



## How it works
Plex Together aims to keep multiple viewing sessions in sync regardless of whether the clients are in the same room or across the globe. To do this Plex Together utilizes a middle-man server to communicate between each of Plex Together clients. Users choose their Plex client, decide on a Plex Together Server and Room name and join up. Your friends/family can do the same. Whoever joins the room first will become the host. 

The host has complete control over a room. Commands they send to their client will be sent through to other people in the room (Play, Pause, Seek etc). If the host starts playing something different, Plex Together will search all of your available Plex Media Servers for an equiavalent copy, even if it is not from the same Plex Media Server as the Host.  

## Features
* Syncing between Plex Clients over the Internet
* Automatic searching of content across all your Plex Media Servers
* Searching from Shared Plex Media Servers
* Metadata fetching from Plex Media Server
* Password locked rooms
* Movies and TV Shows
* Restrict auto play to a specific Plex Media Server

## Getting Started

You need:

* Node v6
* A stable Internet connection
* With node installed either you or your friend will need to run the PT Server. You can run the PT Server from the same machine, but depending on your network setup you may need to enable port forwarding on your router to let others connect. 

## Running PT Client on macOS & Windows

You will need to run Plex Together from the command line:
* Clone this repo
* Navigate to Plex Together directory
* Install dependencies with npm:
  * ``npm install``
* Run using npm
	* ``npm start``

## Running PT Server on macOS, Ubuntu & Windows
* Clone this repo
* cd to the server directory
* Install socket.io
	* ``npm install socket.io -save``
* Run the server
	* ``node server.js``
* By default, the server will listen on 0.0.0.0:8088. Feel free to change this if that port is in use.

## Using Plex Together
Once you've run the app please follow the below steps:

1. Log in with your plex.tv credentials
2. Select your player (make sure the player is open on your device of choice)
3. Click 'Join Room'
	* Enter IP:PORT/URL of PT Server
		* ``http://URL:PORT``
	* Enter room name + password (if applicable)
	* If you see a STAR next to your name you are the host.

Once the above is done you're all set! Depending on whether you're the host or a participant will determine your next steps:

**HOST** - Once all your friends have joined you may start your media in your Plex Player.

**PARTICIPANT** - Wait for the host of the room to start playing media. If the media does not start playing automatically you may manually play the media on your player and Plex Together will keep you in sync.
